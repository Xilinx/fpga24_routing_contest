    NetworkX-based wirelength analyzer

    Given a routed FPGA Interchange Format Physical Netlist this class builds a
    graph containing trees corresponding to physical nets. Each edge in these
    trees represents an electrical connection between the corresponding net's
    source and sink and is assigned a wirelength based on the routing resources
    traversed along that path.

    Next, paths between sequential cells (e.g. FDRE flip-flops) are created by
    adding edges through all combinatorial cells (e.g. LUTs) which in turn
    transforms the graph from a forest of independent trees into a directed
    acyclic graph.

    Lastly, networkx is used to find the longest wirelength path -- from any
    sequential element/top-level port through to any other element/port -- in
    the graph. We term the length of this path as the 'critical-path
    wirelength' and can be considered a proxy for the critical-path delay that
    would be found by a timing analyzer.

    Note that this class assumes that the routed solution is valid -- it does
    not check for overlaps, existence of PIPs, full source-sink connectivity,
    etc.

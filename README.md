Utilities:
* [`net_printer`](https://github.com/Xilinx/fpga24_routing_contest/tree/master/net_printer) -- inspect the routing of nets in a Physical Netlist.
* [`DcpToFPGAIF`](https://github.com/Xilinx/fpga24_routing_contest/pull/10) -- process a DCP into FPGAIF Logical and Physical Netlists for use with this contest.
* [`wirelength_analyzer`](https://github.com/Xilinx/fpga24_routing_contest/tree/master/wirelength_analyzer) -- compute a [critical-path wirelength](https://xilinx.github.io/fpga24_routing_contest/score.html#critical-path-wirelength) for a routed FPGAIF Physical Netlist.
* [`DiffPhysNetlist`](https://github.com/Xilinx/fpga24_routing_contest/pull/66) -- display any illegal differences (placement, intra-site routing, global/static inter-site routing) between two FPGAIF Physical Netlists.
